    <div class="descriptiveParagraph">India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety
        and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India has
        become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialised countries in the
        world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people.
        It covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to
        the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the
        rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical
        entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers
        off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
        Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8° 4' and 37° 6' north,
        longitudes 68° 7' and 97° 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes
        and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km.
        The total length of the coastline of the mainland, Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 7,516.6
        km.</div>
